# TypeR
> A superset language implemented in Go that "types" the R language

## Introduction

According to the language site itself, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is:

_"R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics."_

Because it is a scripting language, R seeks to allow flexibility in the development and prototyping of ideas. Through its weak typing system this can be a problem for applications in production -- it is worth noting that this is not a "problem" of language since it was meant to behave the way it is, but this same behavior may end becoming a difficulty to maintain a great code base in the language.

**TypeR** tries to be for R what [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is for [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), implementing a strong typing system that allows inference and statically typed -- the idea is to go beyond just being types and also to limit the language only to the functional paradigm, cleaning up a little of the multi paradigm of R.

At the end of the day the idea is to write a "functional and typed R code" which will then spit out a normal code in R after all the checks are done, avoiding possible errors when the code is running in production.

## How should it supposed to be?

A small example of how language it's supposed to be one day:

### Functions

```
add := Numeric a => a -> a -> a
add <- function(x, y) x + y
```

The function header is similar to Haskell's -- read more at [functional Approach](#Functional-approach) --; therefore, it also does not need to be declared, the language engine is able to infer the types of the parameters by the operations performed with them in the function body.

```
multiply <- function(x, y) x * y
# multiply := Numeric a => a -> a -> a
```

### Constants

```
result <- add(1, 2)
# result is 3

result <- 4
# This will throw a compiler error, because result is a constant
```

If you want a "constant" to have its value changed, you must use the **let** keyword.

```
let result <- add(1, 2)
# result is 3

result <- 4
# result is 4
```

### Point free notation

```
square <- function(x) x ^ 2

addTwo <- function(x) x + 2

result <- addTwo . square 2
# result is 6
```

### Prefix operations
```
result <- (+) 1 2
# result is 3
```

## Changes from R

- Removing loops as **for**, **while**, **do ... while**;
- ...

## Why

The following topics try to clarify the choice of some design decisions.

### Go

As R alone is not a very performative language, Go was chosen to meet such need.

_"But why Go and not another language?"_

The answer is simple, Go is:

- Easy to read and to write tests
- Has a large community and documentation
- Its concurrent design helps when writing a compiler
- ...


### Functional approach

The choice of just following the functional paradigm is simply a personal decision, since the main use of R for the project author is for mathematical scenarios. Having a background in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), this has greatly influenced prioritizing such a decision.

Even if it does not have some of the practicalities of the functional paradigm like guards and pattern matching, it may be that if it is possible to emulate such designs they are added to the language.

## TODO

- Right now? Everything, nothing is current working
- Create a linter for the language so that more flexible patterns are placed and directed to the community to configure them in the way they think best
- Create code analyzer to perform duplicity analysis and other things just as [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com/) already performs
- Write another packet to transpile the TypeR code into [Julia](https://julialang.org/) code
- Help out [Romain](https://community.rstudio.com/t/running-go-code-from-r/2340/3) write a Go to R integration package or even allow such integration into TypeR itself
- Much more
